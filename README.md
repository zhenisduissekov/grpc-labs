# 🧠 gRPC Mastery: Step-by-Step Guide (Steps 1–17)

This README documents each advanced gRPC feature implemented step-by-step, ideal for learning and evolving production-grade microservices in Go.


---

## ✅ Step 1: Basic Unary RPC – `SayHello`

- A simple request/response method.
- Sends `HelloRequest`, receives `HelloReply`.

```proto
rpc SayHello(HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: Server Streaming – StreamGreetings
- The client sends one request.
- The server responds with a stream of `HelloReply`.

```proto
rpc StreamGreetings(HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply);
```

Use case: live updates, chat history, or data feeds.

⸻

✅ Step 3: Bidirectional Streaming – Chat
- Both the client and server stream messages.
- Enables real-time chat or event-driven applications.

```proto
rpc Chat(stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply);
```

---

✅ Step 4: Interceptors (Middleware)
- Add logic around RPCs: logging, auth, tracing, etc.

```go
grpc.NewServer(
  grpc.UnaryInterceptor(loggingUnaryInterceptor),
)
```

Use cases:
- 🔐 Auth
- 📝 Logging
- 📊 Metrics
- 🔁 Retry

---

✅ Step 5: Metadata-Based Auth (Token)
- Send headers from the client (e.g., authorization, x-user-id).
- Read headers in the interceptor using:

```go
metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)
```

Reject unauthorized requests with:

```go
status.Error(codes.Unauthenticated, "invalid token")
```

---

✅ Step 6: TLS with Self-Signed Certs
- Secure the gRPC channel using TLS.
- Generate certs with SAN using OpenSSL.
- Server uses:

```go
credentials.NewServerTLSFromFile("cert/server.crt", "cert/server.key")
```

Client uses:

```go
credentials.NewClientTLSFromFile("cert/server.crt", "")
```

---

✅ Step 7: Reflection + Health Checking
- Enable server reflection:

```go
reflection.Register(grpcServer)
```

- Add a health check endpoint:

```go
healthpb.RegisterHealthServer(grpcServer, health.NewServer())
```

This enables tools like [`grpcurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl), Kubernetes, and Envoy to monitor the service state.

⸻

✅ Step 8: Prometheus Metrics
- Use `go-grpc-prometheus` to expose metrics like:
  - RPC count
  - Latency
  - Errors

```go
grpc_prometheus.Register(grpcServer)
http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
```

Scrape from Prometheus at :9090/metrics.

⸻

✅ Step 9: OpenTelemetry Tracing with Jaeger
- Set up a tracer with OpenTelemetry.
- Export spans to Jaeger:

```go
go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/jaeger
```

- Wrap gRPC with interceptors:

```go
otelgrpc.UnaryServerInterceptor()
```

View traces in Jaeger UI (http://localhost:16686).

⸻

✅ Step 10: Multi-Service (gRPC → gRPC)
- `GreeterService` calls `LoggerService` via gRPC.
- Both are independent microservices.
- Simulates microservice communication.

Use `grpc.Dial()` to connect inside Greeter and send a request.

⸻

✅ Step 11: Metadata Propagation
- Pass metadata (e.g., `x-user-id`) across services:

```go
metadata.AppendToOutgoingContext(ctx, "x-user-id", "zhenis123")
```

- `LoggerService` reads it from the incoming context:

```go
metadata.FromIncomingContext(ctx)
```

⸻

✅ Step 12: Load Balancing + Service Discovery
- Use gRPC’s built-in round_robin LB:

```go
grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{"loadBalancingPolicy":"round_robin"}`)
```

- Use DNS (e.g., `dns:///host1:60051,host2:60052`) or Kubernetes service discovery.

⸻

✅ Step 13: Retry + Timeout (Optional Extension)
- Use context timeouts:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
```

- Add retry logic around calls (e.g., with backoff or Heimdall).

⸻

✅ Step 14: Circuit Breaker (Resilience)
- Use `github.com/sony/gobreaker`.
- Wrap gRPC calls:

```go
breaker.Execute(func() (interface{}, error) {
  return client.Call(...)
})
```

Avoids cascading failures by stopping bad calls.

⸻

✅ Step 15: Grafana Dashboards
- Visualize:
  - gRPC latency, count, error rate (Prometheus).
  - Traces via Jaeger or Tempo.
- Build dashboards with:
  - Panels for `grpc_server_handled_total`.
  - Heatmaps for latency buckets.

⸻

✅ Step 16: Async gRPC + Kafka/NATS Integration
  - `GreeterService` returns immediately but:
  - Sends a Kafka message to `events.greeted`.
  - `LoggerService` or analytics consume asynchronously.

Use the [`segmentio/kafka-go`](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) library to decouple services and improve scalability.

⸻

✅ Step 17: Versioned APIs + Canary Deployments
- Use versioned packages:

```proto
package greeter.v1;
package greeter.v2;
```

- Run `GreeterV1` and `GreeterV2` side by side.
- Use Envoy/Istio to route traffic:

```yaml
weighted_clusters:
  - name: v1
    weight: 90
  - name: v2
    weight: 10
```

Safe rollout of breaking changes.

- ✅ Step 19: gRPC-Gateway (REST ↔ gRPC)
- ✅ Step 20: CI/CD for gRPC with Docker + K8s
- ✅ Step 21: Request validation (with proto annotations)

Feel free to explore these additional steps to enhance your gRPC services.
