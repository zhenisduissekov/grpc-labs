🧠 gRPC Mastery Lab: A Practical Guide to Building Production-Ready Services

This lab series is a step-by-step, hands-on journey through core and advanced gRPC features. Ideal for backend engineers looking to master gRPC in Go, it combines real-world scenarios with modern best practices like observability, security, microservice communication, and resilience patterns.

🔁 10 Practical Milestones to gRPC Mastery

Each milestone builds on the previous one. You’ll write code, generate .proto files, run services, and integrate with common backend tooling (Prometheus, Jaeger, Kafka, etc).

⸻

✅ Step 1. Basic Unary RPC (Hello World)
	•	Intro to .proto, request/response types, and gRPC code generation.
	•	Build a simple service with SayHello RPC.
	•	Perfect for beginners or quick refresh.

⸻

✅ Step 2. Streaming RPCs
	•	Server streaming: StreamGreetings returns multiple responses.
	•	Bidirectional streaming: Chat enables real-time communication.
	•	Learn how to handle open channels between client and server.

⸻

✅ Step 3. Middleware with Interceptors
	•	Add cross-cutting concerns like:
	•	📝 Logging
	•	🔐 Auth
	•	📊 Metrics
	•	Reusable interceptors wrap around RPC calls.
	•	Realistic production use cases.

⸻

✅ Step 4. Auth with Metadata
	•	Secure your gRPC calls using headers (e.g., tokens).
	•	Learn how to:
	•	Send metadata from clients
	•	Extract + validate it in interceptors
	•	Build custom authentication layers.

⸻

✅ Step 5. TLS Encryption
	•	Use self-signed certs with credentials.NewServerTLSFromFile.
	•	Secure communication channel between client/server.
	•	Foundation for mTLS and zero-trust networking.

⸻

✅ Step 6. Reflection + Health Checks
	•	Add server reflection for tooling support (e.g., grpcurl).
	•	Integrate gRPC health check service for Kubernetes or Envoy.
	•	Enables dynamic service introspection.

⸻

✅ Step 7. Observability (Prometheus + Jaeger)
	•	Add:
	•	Prometheus metrics: request count, error rate, latency
	•	Jaeger tracing: trace every RPC call
	•	Learn to visualize gRPC performance in Grafana.

⸻

✅ Step 8. Microservice-to-Microservice gRPC
	•	One gRPC service calling another (e.g., Greeter → Logger).
	•	Real-world internal communication in microservices.
	•	Includes metadata propagation (x-user-id, etc).

⸻

✅ Step 9. Resilience: Load Balancing, Timeout, Circuit Breaker
	•	Add:
	•	Load balancing with round_robin + DNS
	•	Retry logic and context timeouts
	•	Circuit breakers with sony/gobreaker
	•	Covers production-grade reliability patterns.

⸻

✅ Step 10. Async Workflows + Versioning
	•	Trigger async pipelines (Kafka or NATS) after gRPC completes.
	•	Run v1 and v2 APIs side-by-side.
	•	Safely roll out changes using:
	•	Envoy / Istio canary routing
	•	Package versioning (greeter.v1, greeter.v2)

🛠️ Bonus Extensions (Optional Labs)

Feature	Description
Step 11	Rate limiting per user/service
Step 12	REST ↔ gRPC with grpc-gateway
Step 13	CI/CD with Docker + K8s
Step 14	Request validation with proto annotations


⸻

✅ Who is this for?
	•	👨‍💻 Go developers building microservices
	•	🧪 Backend engineers working with gRPC APIs
	•	📈 DevOps / Platform teams adding observability and resilience
	•	🧠 Anyone who wants to build, secure, scale, and monitor gRPC services like a pro
